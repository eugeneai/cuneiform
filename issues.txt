Issues detected during porting phase

Cuneiform uses Windows' wchar_t, which is 16 bit. On Unix it is 32 bit.

vertstr.cpp does GUI drawing or somesuch. Disabled everything.

BYTE and CHAR are used interchangeably. Subtracting BYTE* from CHAR* gives
"invalid operands to binary -" error message.

Disabled use of dfon library. It seems to be some external dll file.
I have no idea what it's supposed to do.

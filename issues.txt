Issues detected during porting phase

Cuneiform uses Windows' wchar_t, which is 16 bit. On Unix it is 32 bit.

vertstr.cpp does GUI drawing or somesuch. Disabled everything.

BYTE and CHAR are used interchangeably. Subtracting BYTE* from CHAR* gives
"invalid operands to binary -" error message.

Disabled use of dfon library. It seems to be some external dll file.
I have no idea what it's supposed to do.

The russian comments are encoded with CP1251.

As far as I can see, the code has two main deliverables codenamed Puma and Tiger.
Puma seems to be a DLL with the actual recognition code whereas Tiger
is an OLE (or something like that) wrapper. Puma has an additional library
collection called rpstr.

The RLING subdirectory seems to be compiled twice with slightly different
definitions.
